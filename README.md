# colabcctbxsnips

[CCTBX](https://cci.lbl.gov/docs/cctbx/) code fragment library in the form of a Google Colab snippet notebook. This library is a small collection of the code fragment to aid doing routine and not so routine computational tasks in protein crystallography. Accessing the snippets requires using a new Colab notebook. 

Click on the blue button below to open the notebook on Colab and follow the instructions at the top of the notebook on how to copy the notebook to Google Drive and then make it available to new Colab notebooks. This step has to be done only once. The snippets will be available on your next log-in although files and software installed on Colab with not be available on your next login to Colab.

## Local viewing

This notebook can be viewed locally in the [*nteract.app*](https://nteract.io/) -- an easy to install desktop application for viewing and editing Jupyter notebook documents (*.ipynb)--, *Jupyter Notebook*, or *Jupyter Lab*, but utilization of the snippets requires use of Colab.

Sample data files are located in the dataFiles folder.
Copy this folder to Google Drive to ease accessing the sample data on Colab.

## Related project: jupyterlabcctbxsnips

Similar snippets are available for local use in JupyterLab [jupyterlabcctbxsnips](https://github.com/MooersLab/jupyterlabcctbxsnips). 
This library is for a menu-driven snippet extension.

## Future plans:

I plan to make this library available for the Elyra snippet extension for Jupyter Lab shortly.

## Reporting errors

The CCTBX is under continuous development. 
Some of the functions get renamed or deleted.
Post an issue for functions that do not work.
