# colabcctbxsnips

[CCTBX](https://cci.lbl.gov/docs/cctbx/) code fragment library in a Colab snippet notebook. Accessing the snippets requires running the notebook as a Colab notebook. This is a small collection of the code fragment to add doing routine and not so routine computational tasks in protein crystallography.

Click on the blue button below to open the notebook on Colab. Follow the instructions at the top of the notebook.

This notebook can be viewed locally in the `nteract.app`, Jupyter Notebook, or Jupyter Lab, but utilization of the snippets requires use of Colab.
